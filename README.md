## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of Stellaris Localisation Syntax.

### 1.1.0

- Fixed screenshot image
- This is suppose to be a patch (v1.0.1), but a mistake was made in publishing the extension, which advanced the version as if it were a minor update... Nothing can be changed now, so be it.
